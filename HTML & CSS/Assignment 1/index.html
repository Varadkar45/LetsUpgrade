    <!-- Paragraph-->
    <p>Like most successfully managed institutions, RAIT also believes in following the principles of democratic governance. Various committees are set up to ensure the smooth functioning of the institute. Regular and periodic meetings are held among the committees which involve the management, faculty and staff to address essential issues and to ensure proper coordination among the various departments, committee conveners and administrative staff.  An institution progresses when its mainstay, the student community prospers. This can be seen in the various steps taken by the institute to ensure a contented student force in its campus. Counsellors are appointed to counsel the students and redress their grievances if any. An institution grows only when it makes appropriate changes from time to time. Such a change is possible only if there is a feedback system. The institution follows an efficient system of collecting feedback about faculty performance from the students. The faculty appraisals are collected and reviewed periodically by Quality Assurance Team of RAIT.</p>
